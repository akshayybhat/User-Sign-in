# Authentication System

## Overview

This project is designed as a learning tool for understanding authentication processes using JWT, ZOD, and Mongoose. It features a simple user interface for creating accounts and logging in. Once logged in, users can view all stored usernames and passwords, making it useful for dummy projects.

## Features

- User registration and login
- JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication
- Input validation using ZOD
- MongoDB for storing user credentials
- Displays all usernames and passwords after login (for learning purposes only)

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **Validation**: ZOD
- **Database**: MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- MongoDB Atlas account or local MongoDB instance

### Important Notes

- This project is intended for learning purposes only. Do not use it in production environments.
- Displaying usernames and passwords in plaintext is insecure and should never be done in real applications.
